# Simulation

This page outlines the various simulation frameworks that you can use to get started on training your own locomotion policies.

## Prerequisites

- Laptop or Desktop with a sufficient GPU or access to cloud GPUs like Runpod or Lambda

## Overview

We currently support 3 main simulation workflows.

## K-Sim

K-sim is built upon Mujoco's MJX simulator

## IsaacLab

We are currently supporting IsaacSim 5.0

## IsaacGym

We currently support IsaacGym because many reference implementations for the Unitree G1 are written for IsaacGym and are being ported over to IsaacLab by the IsaacLab team at Nvidia
